1. a) How many free clusters are available after all commands are executed? 10
b) How many contiguous free regions exist in the FAT (i.e., blocks of adjacent free 
clusters)? 2
c) Based on the above, does your FAT table exhibit external fragmentation? Justify your 
answer. YES

2. Allocation Behavior and File Paths 
a) For each file (document.txt, image.jpg, video.mp4, notes.txt), list the exact sequence of 
cluster numbers allocated. 
document.txt：0 → 1 → 2EOF
image.jpg：3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7EOF
video.mp4：0 → 1 → 2 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12EOF
notes.txt：13 → 14EOF

b) How does the deletion of document.txt and image.jpg affect the availability of clusters? 0-7 FREE

c) Was video.mp4 allocated in a fragmented way (non-contiguous clusters)? If so, explain 
how your FAT handles it. 
fragmented: YES
use first fit, take 0 1 2 then take 8 and after
0 → 1 → 2 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12EOF

3. Efficiency & Limitations 
a) Could you allocate a new file of size 10 clusters at the end of this sequence? Why or why 
not? 
YES, we have 10 free cluster.

b) Even if total free clusters are ≥ 10, explain why such allocation may fail in your current 
implementation. 
it won't fail in my system, unless the file name already exist

c) How does this reflect real-world issues with the FAT filesystem? 
It highlights how FAT’s fragmented cluster chains cause degraded I/O performance due to increased pointer
 chasing and disk head movement.

4. Optimization Proposal 
• Propose a concrete strategy or enhancement to improve file allocation or reduce 
fragmentation. Choose one: 
Justify your proposed change with respect to your simulation’s behavior and its impact on 
performance.

Keep a list of free blocks with start and size. When a file is deleted, join blocks that 
are next to each other. This makes bigger free space and less break up.
